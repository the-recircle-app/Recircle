# ReCircle - Sustainable Transportation Rewards Platform

## Overview

ReCircle is a blockchain-powered rewards platform designed to incentivize sustainable transportation choices. It distributes B3TR tokens to users who submit receipts from approved ride-share services, electric vehicle rentals, and public transportation. The platform integrates with VeBetterDAO's smart contract ecosystem and uses OpenAI Vision API for automated receipt validation and fraud prevention, creating a comprehensive and rewarding ecosystem for sustainable mobility. ReCircle aims to promote eco-friendly travel habits and offers a scalable solution for rewarding users while generating revenue for platform operations.
