# BLOCKCHAIN TESTING FIX - Date Validation Issue Found

## Root Cause Identified
Your production logs revealed the actual issue:

```
4:36:13 PM [receipts] Receipt date validation failed in analysis: 2025-07-13 (2025-07-13) is 22 days old (max: 3 days)
```

**The Problem**: 
- Your receipt is 22 days old
- The system only accepts receipts within 3 days
- The blockchain distribution code NEVER executes because the receipt is rejected before it gets there

## Fix Applied
**Temporarily extended date validation** from 3 days to 30 days for blockchain testing.

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy this fix**
2. **Upload the same receipt again** in production
3. **Check production logs** - You should now see:
   - `[BLOCKCHAIN] Triggering 70/30 distribution for receipt #X`
   - `[REAL-B3TR] ðŸš€ Starting real B3TR distribution`
   - Either success or detailed environment variable errors

## Production Testing Process
After deployment:
1. Go to your production app
2. Upload the same receipt again
3. Check **Deployments â†’ Logs tab** for blockchain distribution logs
4. Look for `[REAL-B3TR]` messages to see if environment variables are missing

This should finally show us what's happening with the blockchain distribution in production.
