# DEBUG MODE ENABLED FOR BLOCKCHAIN TESTING

## Issue Found
Production logs showed:
```
5:53:48 PM [receipts] Correcting old date in validation data: 2025-07-13 â†’ 2025-08-04
```

**The logs cut off here** because debug mode was disabled in production, preventing blockchain distribution logs from appearing.

## Fix Applied
**Temporarily enabled debug mode in production** by forcing `isDeveloperDebugMode = true` in the receipt validation endpoint.

## What This Will Show
After redeploying, you should now see in production logs:
- `[BLOCKCHAIN] Triggering 70/30 distribution for receipt #X`
- `[REAL-B3TR] ðŸš€ Starting real B3TR distribution`
- `[REAL-B3TR] Environment variables check: DISTRIBUTOR_PRIVATE_KEY=***`
- Either success messages or detailed error logs about missing environment variables

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy this fix**
2. **Upload the same receipt again** in production
3. **Check production logs** for detailed blockchain distribution process
4. **Look for `[REAL-B3TR]` messages** to see environment variable status

This will finally reveal what's preventing the blockchain distribution from working in production.
