Here’s a single “Replit Task Card” you can paste into your Replit README or a scratch file—Replit will pick up the steps and you can tick them off as you go:

# 🚀 Task: Get Real B3TR Showing in VeWorld on Solo Node

Follow each section **in a real local shell**, not in Replit’s preview pane or iframe.

---

## 1️⃣ Clone & Deploy Your Solo Node

```bash
# from your repo root
cd apps/contracts
yarn solo up                 # spins up Thor Solo in Docker on localhost:8669
yarn contracts:deploy solo   # deploys mock B3TR, X2EARN pool, EcoEarn
✅ You should see ThorSolo running … listening on 8669

✅ Deployment script prints your B3TR & EcoEarn addresses

2️⃣ Start Your React + Vite Front‑End
bash
Copy
Edit
# in a separate terminal
cd ../../apps/frontend
yarn         # install deps
yarn dev     # starts Vite on http://localhost:3000 (or the port printed)
✅ Note the “Local:” URL (e.g. http://localhost:3000)

🔍 DO NOT use Replit’s “preview” iframe—open that URL in your browser

3️⃣ Configure VeWorld Extension for Solo
Open Chrome → VeWorld extension → ⚙️ Settings → Networks → + Add network

Fill in:

Network Name: VeChain Solo

RPC URL: http://localhost:8669

Chain Tag (Hex): 0x27

Save & select “VeChain Solo” as your active network

✅ VeWorld now points at your Solo node

4️⃣ Add Your B3TR Token in VeWorld
In VeWorld main view → My Tokens → + Add Token

Enter:

Token Address: 0x5ef79995fe8a89e0812330e4378eb2660cede699

Symbol: B3TR

Decimals: 18

Confirm the popup

✅ You should now see “B3TR 0.00” under My Tokens

5️⃣ Run an End‑to‑End Receipt Test
In your running React UI (on localhost:3000)—scan/submit a sample receipt

Wait ~10 s for on‑chain mint/transfer

In VeWorld → My Tokens, refresh

✅ Your B3TR balance should jump up by the amount your backend distributed

❗️ Troubleshooting
“window.vechain.request is not a function” → make sure you’re on a real localhost:PORT page with the VeWorld extension enabled, not in an iframe.

No balance change → check your Solo node logs for the transaction hash; curl the Solo JSON‑RPC (eth_getBalance) to verify on‑chain.

Port mismatch → read the “Local:” line when you run yarn dev, or fix it with --port or in vite.config.js.

🎉 Done! No production deploy required—everything runs locally so that VeWorld can inject window.vechain and you’ll see real B3TR on Solo.
