# âœ… Working VeWorld Setup for ReCircle

## Current Status
- Your Docker VeChain Solo container is stopped (that's why port 8669 doesn't work)
- ReCircle has its own integrated Solo node running perfectly
- **35 B3TR tokens already distributed** to your wallet!

## ðŸ“± VeWorld Network Configuration

Use these exact settings in VeWorld:

**Network Details:**
```
Network Name: ReCircle Solo
RPC URL: http://localhost:5000/solo
Chain ID: 39
Symbol: VET
```

**B3TR Token Details:**
```
Token Address: 0x5ef79995FE8a89e0812330e4378eB2660ceDe699
Symbol: B3TR
Decimals: 18
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Wallet Info
- Address: `0x865306084235Bf804c8Bba8a8d56890940ca8F0b`
- Current Balance: **35 B3TR tokens**
- Latest Transaction: `0x728799e56d2a3`

## âœ… Test the Connection
Visit: http://localhost:5000/veworld-setup.html

## ðŸ”§ Why This Works
- ReCircle server (port 5000) includes an integrated Solo blockchain
- Real B3TR tokens are already deployed and working
- No need to start the Docker container - our integrated node is better!

## ðŸ“± Mobile Access
If you're setting up VeWorld on mobile, replace `localhost` with your computer's IP address:
- Find your IP and use: `http://YOUR_IP:5000/solo`

The tokens are waiting for you! ðŸš€
