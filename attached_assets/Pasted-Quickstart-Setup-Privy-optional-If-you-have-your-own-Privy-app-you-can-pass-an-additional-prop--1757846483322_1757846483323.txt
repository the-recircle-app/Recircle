Quickstart
Setup Privy (optional)
If you have your own Privy app, you can pass an additional prop with your settings.

Copy
import { VechainKitProvider } from '@vechain/vechain-kit';

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
    return (
        <VechainKitProvider
            privy={{
                appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID!,
                clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID!,
                loginMethods: ['google', 'twitter', 'sms', 'email'],
                appearance: {
                    walletList: ['metamask', 'rainbow'],
                    accentColor: '#696FFD',
                    loginMessage: 'Select a social media profile',
                    logo: 'https://i.ibb.co/ZHGmq3y/image-21.png',
                },
                embeddedWallets: {
                    createOnLogin: 'all-users',
                },
                allowPasskeyLinking: true,
            }}
            ...
            //other props
        >
            {children}
        </VechainKitProvider>
    );
}
Go to privy.io and create an app. You will find the APP ID and the CLIENT ID in the App Settings tab.

For further information on how to implement Privy SDK please refer to their docs: https://docs.privy.io/

This project uses:

@privy-io/react-auth for Privy connection type

@privy-io/cross-app-connect for ecosystem cross app connection

You can import privy from the kit as 

Copy
import { usePrivy } from "@vechain/vechain-kit";

const { user } = usePrivy();
If you setup your own Privy be sure to go over the recommended security settings provided by Privy: 
https://docs.privy.io/guide/security/implementation/ and https://docs.privy.io/guide/security/implementation/csp

Pros of self hosting Privy:

No UI confirmations on users transactions

Allow your users to backup their keys and update security settings directly in your app

Targetted social login methods

Cons:

Price

Responsibilities to correctly secure your Privy account, since it contains access to user's wallet settings

Your users will need to login into other apps through ecosystem mode
