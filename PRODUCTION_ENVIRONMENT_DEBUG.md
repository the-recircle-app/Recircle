# Production Environment Debug - HDNode Error Fix

## Issue Identified
The production error shows: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` when creating HDNode.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs in thor-devkit's HDNode.fromPrivateKey() when the private key buffer is malformed or undefined.

## Environment Variable Status
✅ DISTRIBUTOR_PRIVATE_KEY: exists
✅ B3TR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: exists  
✅ X2EARNREWARDSPOOL_ADDRESS: exists

## Applied Fixes
1. **Enhanced Private Key Validation**:
   - Length validation (must be 64 hex characters)
   - Hex format validation
   - Buffer creation error handling
   - Detailed logging at each step

2. **Production-Safe Error Handling**:
   - Clear error messages for each validation step
   - Graceful fallback when HDNode creation fails
   - Comprehensive logging for production debugging

## Expected Production Logs After Deployment
```
[REAL-B3TR] Private key validation:
[REAL-B3TR] - Raw length: 66
[REAL-B3TR] - Has 0x prefix: true
[REAL-B3TR] - Clean key length: 64
[REAL-B3TR] - Buffer created successfully, length: 32
[REAL-B3TR] Creating HDNode from validated private key...
[REAL-B3TR] ✅ HDNode created successfully
```

If the error persists, the logs will now show exactly which validation step fails, allowing precise diagnosis of the production environment issue.
