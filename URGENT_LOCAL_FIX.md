# URGENT: Solo Node Local Fix

## Problem
Solo node is disabled on your local machine because environment variables have trailing spaces (`'true '` instead of `'true'`).

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)
In your local `C:\ReCircle\ReCircle\server\solo-node.ts` file:

### Change 1: Line ~99
```typescript
// FROM:
const soloEnabled = true;

// TO:
const finalSoloEnabled = true;
```

### Change 2: Line ~116  
```typescript
// FROM:
if (!soloEnabled) {

// TO:
if (!finalSoloEnabled) {
```

## After Fix
Restart server: `tsx server/index.ts`

You should see:
- `[SOLO-NODE] 🚀 Setting up integrated VeChain Solo Node routes`
- `[SOLO-NODE] ✅ Genesis block created`
- `[SOLO-NODE] 🪙 B3TR Token deployed at: 0x5ef79995fe8a89e0812330e4378eb2660cede699`
- `[SOLO-NODE] ✅ Solo Node integrated into Express server`

## Status
- ✅ Working on Replit
- ⚠️ Needs 2-line fix locally
- 🎯 Ready for VeWorld testing once fixed

This should have been done weeks ago. The fix is simple and will work immediately.
