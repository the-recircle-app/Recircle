# Local Testing Solutions for VeWorld Wallet Connection

## Problem
- VeWorld mobile browser won't connect to development environment
- Need to test wallet connection without breaking existing code
- Want to test complete receipt flow before deploying

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Deploy to Replit (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- VeWorld mobile browser will connect to deployed URL
- No code changes needed
- Test complete flow with real testnet
- Get actual B3TR tokens

**Steps:**
1. Click "Deploy" in Replit to get production URL
2. Get testnet VET from faucet.vechain.org
3. Test with VeWorld mobile on deployed URL

### Option 2: Local Network Simulation
**Pros:**
- Test locally without deployment
- Safe environment for testing

**Requirements:**
- Solo Node running on localhost:8669
- Configure app to use solo network
- VeWorld can connect to Solo Node

**Steps:**
1. Run Solo Node: `./bin/thor solo --on-demand --api-addr 0.0.0.0:8669`
2. Update environment to use solo network
3. Test with VeWorld mobile pointing to your IP:8669

### Option 3: Hybrid Testing Approach
**Current Setup:**
- Your app already supports both simulation and real blockchain
- TEST_MODE=false means real blockchain transactions
- TEST_MODE=true means simulated transactions

**For Testing Without Wallet:**
1. Set TEST_MODE=true
2. Test receipt validation and AI processing
3. Verify reward calculations work
4. Deploy when ready for real wallet testing

## Recommendation

Since your app is already perfectly configured for testnet, I recommend **Option 1: Deploy to Replit**. This gives you:

- Real wallet connections with VeWorld mobile
- Actual B3TR token testing
- No code changes required
- Complete validation of your VeBetterDAO integration

The deployment is your most direct path to testing the complete user flow.
