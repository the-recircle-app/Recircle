Here’s the reality of Solo: it’s a completely fresh chain, so nothing from Testnet exists there — no B3TR token contract, no RewardDistributor, etc. You need to treat Solo like its own blockchain and:

1. Deploy B3TR (and your reward contracts) onto Solo
Compile & deploy your B3TR token contract (the same ERC‑20 style you use on Testnet) against your Solo node.

Deploy the VeBetterDAO RewardDistributor contract, pointing its constructor at your new B3TR address (and your X2Earn pool, treasury, etc.).

Copy those new addresses into your backend’s config (not the Testnet ones).

This step makes “distribute…” calls actually land on Solo instead of silently failing on a non‑existent Testnet contract.

2. Configure your wallet to see that token
In VeWorld → Settings → Connections, make sure your DApp’s localhost URL (e.g. http://localhost:3000) is added—don’t rely on Chrome’s site‑access toggle.

Switch VeWorld’s Network to your Solo network (you’ve already added it at http://localhost:8669, chainTag=0x1a).

In VeWorld’s My Tokens tab click Add Token, and paste your Solo‐deployed B3TR contract address, plus symbol B3TR and decimals (usually 18).

Now VeWorld will track that token’s Transfer events and show balances.

3. Send real transfers via a manually‑configured provider
Ethers’ default JsonRpcProvider will endlessly “fail to detect network” on Solo. Bypass it by forcing the chain ID when you instantiate it:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

// Point at Solo RPC + tell ethers exactly what chain it is
const soloUrl    = 'http://localhost:8669'
const soloChain  = { name: 'vechain-solo', chainId: 0x1a }  // match your genesis

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(soloUrl, soloChain)
const wallet   = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY_OF_DISTRIBUTOR, provider)

const b3tr = new ethers.Contract(
  SOLO_B3TR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  B3TR_ABI,
  wallet
)

await b3tr.transfer(userAddress, amount)        // real on‑chain token transfer
No more spam: by passing { chainId, name } you skip auto‑detection.

Real TXNs: your Solo node now accepts and mines your transfer(...) calls.

4. Verify & watch it happen
In your backend, log the txHash and watch Solo’s curl localhost:8669/transactions/{txHash} — you’ll see the Transfer event.

In VeWorld (Solo network), the balance under My Tokens → B3TR for your user address will update once the block is sealed (≈10 s).

TL;DR Checklist
✍️ Deploy B3TR & reward contracts to Solo (DON’T use Testnet addresses).

🔑 Use your distributor’s private key and a forced‑chain JsonRpcProvider.

🔗 Add the Solo network & your DApp origin in VeWorld, then Add Token with your new B3TR address.

🚀 Transfer real tokens on Solo → watch balances appear in VeWorld.

Once you’ve done those 4 steps, Solo behaves just like Testnet but under your control, and B3TR transfers will be visible.
