# ReCircle - Sustainable Transportation Rewards Platform

## Overview

ReCircle is a blockchain-powered rewards platform designed to incentivize sustainable transportation choices. It distributes B3TR tokens to users who submit receipts from approved ride-share services, electric vehicle rentals, and public transportation. The platform integrates with VeBetterDAO's smart contract ecosystem and uses OpenAI Vision API for automated receipt validation and fraud prevention, creating a comprehensive and rewarding ecosystem for sustainable mobility. ReCircle aims to promote eco-friendly travel habits and offers a scalable solution for rewarding users while generating revenue for platform operations.

## Recent Progress

**August 6, 2025**:
- âœ… MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Implemented real VeWorld wallet balance reading like Mugshot
- âœ… Token balance now reads actual B3TR from user's VeWorld wallet instead of database
- âœ… Following official VeChain documentation patterns for Connex balanceOf calls
- âœ… Added intelligent caching (30s) to prevent excessive blockchain calls
- âœ… CLEANUP COMPLETE: Removed all legacy redeem components and endpoints
  - Deleted redeem.tsx, redeem-modern.tsx, VeChainKitRedeemButton.tsx
  - Removed /api/redeem-pending-tokens endpoint from server
  - Eliminated "Redeem Pending Tokens" button and all redeem routes
- âœ… Clean navigation flow: Welcome page only shows when wallet disconnected
- âœ… Fixed visual alignment issues on welcome page (transportation icons & bullet points)
- âœ… Backend VeChain Thor REST API endpoint for balance reading fallback
- ðŸŽ¯ Result: Complete parity with Mugshot's real wallet balance system + eliminated unnecessary manual redemption

**August 5, 2025**: 
- âœ… COMPLETE SUCCESS: Real B3TR blockchain distribution working in production!
- âœ… Fixed HDNode creation error using thor.secp256k1 + thor.address approach
- âœ… Fixed ethers.parseEther import error that was terminating the server
- âœ… Frontend properly calls both validation AND submission endpoints
- âœ… Production deployment successful with real VeChain testnet integration
- âœ… VERIFIED: Real transactions submitted to VeChain testnet
  - User TX: 0x501a9ab1d69e9d1e3e72588f2508559338f5be9316dcd0cef6cb0f1c8ac3b66d

**August 4, 2025**: 
- âœ… CRITICAL FIX: Eliminated JsonRpcProvider errors causing production token distribution failures
- âœ… Created simple-real-distribution.ts using VeChain Thor REST API instead of ethers.js JSON-RPC

- âœ… Implemented direct B3TR token transfers with proper 70/30 split to user and app fund wallets
- âœ… Production secrets configured: B3TR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS and X2EARNREWARDSPOOL_ADDRESS available
- âœ… Server logs show successful local testing: token balance increases from 18.5 â†’ 24 tokens
- âœ… Eliminated syntax errors in routes.ts preventing server startup
- âœ… Real blockchain distribution now bypasses broken VeBetterDAO rewards system

- âœ… PRODUCTION READY: Pierre VeBetterDAO patterns fully integrated into main ReCircle app
- âœ… Real OpenAI Vision API validation system working (GPT-4o model)
- âœ… Automatic B3TR token distribution for valid receipts (threshold: score > 0.5)
- âœ… Smart Upload component with drag-and-drop receipt processing
- âœ… Complete backend integration: /api/receipts/validate uses Pierre's validation system
- âœ… Production scan page updated with Smart Upload mode
