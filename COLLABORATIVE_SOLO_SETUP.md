# Collaborative Solo Node Setup Plan

## Your Role (Local Machine)
### Setup Tasks (I'll provide exact commands)
- Install Docker Desktop
- Run VeChain solo node container
- Configure VeWorld to connect to your local node
- Test wallet connection

### Information You'll Share With Me
- Your local IP address (for Replit integration)
- Solo node status (running/not running)
- VeWorld connection success/failure
- Token visibility results

## My Role (Replit Development)
### Preparation (Before Your Setup)
- Create deployment scripts for B3TR contracts
- Prepare Replit environment configuration
- Build integration endpoints for solo node
- Create testing workflows

### During Your Setup
- Guide you through each Docker command
- Help troubleshoot connection issues
- Provide VeWorld configuration details
- Debug any networking problems

### After Your Solo Node is Running
- Deploy B3TR contracts to your solo node
- Update Replit to connect to your solo node
- Test complete receipt → token distribution flow
- Verify B3TR tokens appear in your VeWorld wallet

## Information Flow: Solo Node → Replit

### What We'll Extract from Solo Node Testing
```javascript
// Contract addresses deployed on your solo node
const SOLO_CONTRACTS = {
  B3TR_TOKEN: "0x...", // Deployed B3TR contract address
  REWARD_POOL: "0x...", // ReCircle reward distribution contract
  GOVERNANCE: "0x..." // VeBetterDAO governance contract (if needed)
};

// Network configuration that works
const SOLO_CONFIG = {
  networkUrl: "http://YOUR_IP:8669",
  chainId: 39,
  gasPrice: "1000000000000000", // What works for gas
  gasLimit: "500000" // Optimal gas limits
};

// Transaction patterns that succeed
const WORKING_TX_PATTERN = {
  nonce: "auto",
  gasPrice: SOLO_CONFIG.gasPrice,
  data: "0x...", // Exact contract call data
  signature: "..." // Signing pattern that works
};
```

### Integration Back to Replit
1. **Environment Variables**: I'll update `.env` with your solo node details
2. **Contract Integration**: Use deployed contract addresses from solo node
3. **Transaction Logic**: Apply the working patterns to production code
4. **Testing Endpoints**: Create Replit endpoints that call your solo node

## Benefits of This Approach
- **You're not alone**: I guide every step and handle all the code integration
- **Real testing**: Actual B3TR tokens in your VeWorld wallet
- **Risk-free**: Solo node costs nothing, no real money involved
- **Complete solution**: We test the entire flow before touching mainnet
- **Reusable**: Once working, we have the exact pattern for production

## Timeline
- **Solo Node Setup**: 30-60 minutes (with my guidance)
- **Contract Deployment**: 15 minutes (I handle the scripts)
- **Replit Integration**: 30 minutes (I update the codebase)
- **End-to-End Testing**: 15 minutes (we verify together)

Total: 1.5-2 hours to have a completely working system with real B3TR tokens in VeWorld.
