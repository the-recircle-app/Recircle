## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- VeWorld wallet extension
- Replit account (for deployment)

### Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-recircle-app/Recircle.git
cd Recircle
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys and configuration
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Required API Keys
- **OpenAI API Key**: For receipt validation
- **VeChain Configuration**: Testnet endpoints and wallet setup
- **Google Sheets API**: For manual review integration

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript and Vite
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components
- **VeChain Connex** for wallet integration
- **TanStack React Query** for state management

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express** with TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM
- **VeChain Thor** blockchain integration
- **OpenAI Vision API** for receipt analysis

### Blockchain
- **VeChain Thor** testnet/mainnet ready
- **B3TR tokens** (VIP-180 standard)
- **Smart contract integration** with VeBetterDAO
- **Real transaction verification** and processing

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Receipt Upload** → User uploads transportation receipt via drag-and-drop interface
2. **AI Validation** → OpenAI Vision API analyzes receipt for authenticity and compliance
3. **Smart Distribution** → Automatic approval triggers blockchain token distribution
4. **Manual Review** → Complex cases routed to Google Sheets for admin review
5. **Token Rewards** → B3TR tokens distributed to user's VeWorld wallet
6. **Achievement Tracking** → Progress recorded with environmental impact metrics

## 🔐 Security

- **Comprehensive fraud detection** with duplicate prevention
- **Secure API key management** with environment variables
- **Rate limiting** on all endpoints
- **Session-based authentication** for admin functions
- **Blockchain transaction verification** for all token distributions
