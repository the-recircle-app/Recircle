# Test Your Current Form - Ready to Use!

## Test the Form Right Now:

1. **Go to your form**: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxRDnbdpsjPpdIiVIMmyqF6irYVsIYI11F-HumlwhhB0-IWjHsHGDuFqgoxurc09IY-/exec

2. **Fill in these test values**:
   - **Receipt ID**: `manual_test_002`
   - **User ID**: `102`
   - **Service**: `Uber Pool Ride`  
   - **Amount**: `28.75`
   - **Decision**: Select "âœ… Approve Receipt"
   - **Notes**: `Test manual approval via form`

3. **Click "Submit Review"**

## What Should Happen:

- Form submits successfully
- You get a response message
- Check the Google Apps Script execution logs to see if webhook was sent
- Check ReCircle to see if user 102 received tokens

## Current Status:

Your form is **live and ready** to test right now. The missing wallet field won't prevent testing since the script can use a default wallet address for now.

## If You Want the Updated Version:

Later, you can update the Google Apps Script code to include the wallet field and better error handling, but the current version should work for immediate testing.

**Go ahead and test it!** Fill out the form and see if tokens get distributed.
