# Alternative VeWorld Testing Approach

## Issue Identified
VeWorld mobile app can't access port 8669 through Replit's public URL due to port restrictions.

## Solution 1: Desktop Testing
If you have access to a desktop browser with VeWorld extension:
- **RPC URL**: `http://localhost:8669`
- **Chain ID**: `39`
- This should work for local desktop testing

## Solution 2: Use Testnet (Recommended)
Since the solo node setup is complex for mobile, let's test with the existing testnet configuration:

1. Keep VeWorld on **VeChain Testnet**
2. Connect to your ReCircle app normally  
3. The app will detect it's not solo mode
4. Submit a transportation receipt
5. Watch the backend logs for transaction processing

## Solution 3: Mobile Browser Testing
Try opening VeWorld in mobile browser and use:
- **RPC URL**: `https://ba885181-7e95-4972-b432-aff26f9a0d30-00-1owy7uwyvgyc6.picard.replit.dev`
- Remove the `:8669` port entirely

## Current Status
- ✅ ReCircle app running on port 5000
- ✅ Solo node running on port 8669 (localhost only)
- ❌ Mobile VeWorld can't access solo node through public URL

The simplest path forward is testnet testing to verify the complete user experience works.
