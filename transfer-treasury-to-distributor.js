// Simple solution: Transfer B3TR from treasury wallet to distributor wallet
// This will enable direct transfers from the distributor wallet that we already have configured

console.log('=== TREASURY TO DISTRIBUTOR B3TR TRANSFER ===');
console.log('Problem: Distributor wallet (0xF1f7...84Ee) has no B3TR tokens');
console.log('Solution: Transfer some B3TR from treasury (0x15d0...5653) to distributor');

// This would need to be done either:
// 1. Through VeBetterDAO governance dashboard (if it wasn't frozen)
// 2. Using treasury wallet private key directly 
// 3. Manual transfer via VeWorld wallet

console.log('MANUAL SOLUTION STEPS:');
console.log('1. Open VeWorld wallet with treasury account (0x15d009b3a5811fde66f19b2db1d40172d53e5653)');
console.log('2. Send B3TR tokens to distributor wallet (0xf1f72b305b7bf7b25e85d356927af36b88dc84ee)');
console.log('3. Amount: Transfer ~1000 B3TR to distributor for testing');
console.log('4. Once distributor has B3TR, direct transfers will work');

console.log('CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS:');
console.log('✅ VeChain SDK configured correctly');
console.log('✅ Gas sponsorship working (/by/90)');
console.log('✅ Transaction detection fixed');
console.log('✅ Direct B3TR transfer code implemented');
