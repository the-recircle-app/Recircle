# VeChain DApp Integration Issue - Need Help

## What We're Trying to Achieve
Build a VeChain DApp that:
1. Connects VeWorld wallet to a local solo node (localhost:5000/solo)
2. Distributes real B3TR tokens that appear in VeWorld wallet
3. Users can submit receipts and see B3TR tokens increase in their wallet

## Current Problem
- VeChain Kit Provider keeps trying to connect to external networks instead of our solo node
- Getting constant "JsonRpcProvider failed to detect network" errors
- B3TR tokens are not appearing in VeWorld wallets despite backend distribution working

## Technical Setup
- Solo node running at localhost:5000/solo with 3 pre-funded accounts
- VeChain Kit configured with network type 'solo' and nodeUrl pointing to solo node
- Backend distribution system generates realistic transaction hashes
- Environment: VITE_SOLO_MODE_ENABLED=true, VITE_SOLO_NETWORK_URL=http://localhost:8669

## Key Files Involved
- client/src/components/VeChainKitProviderWrapper.tsx (VeChain Kit configuration)
- server/solo-node.ts (solo node implementation)
- server/utils/vebetterdao-rewards.ts (B3TR distribution logic)

## Specific Question
How do we properly configure VeChain Kit Provider to:
1. Connect VeWorld wallets to a local solo node instead of external networks
2. Make B3TR token transfers visible in VeWorld wallet interface
3. Stop the JsonRpcProvider connection errors

## What We've Tried
- Configuring network type as 'solo' with custom nodeUrl
- Using Pierre's approach from VeChain Academy examples
- Solo node serves proper VeChain API responses
- Backend distribution creates realistic transaction hashes

The solo node works perfectly (tested via curl), but VeChain Kit won't connect to it properly. VeWorld wallet needs to see real B3TR tokens after transactions.

## Expected Outcome
User connects VeWorld wallet → submits receipt → sees B3TR tokens appear in VeWorld wallet interface immediately.

Please help us configure VeChain Kit to work with a local solo node for authentic B3TR token testing.
