# âœ… VeWorld Connection to Real Solo Node

## Solo Node Status: RUNNING PERFECTLY
- Container: `e4eabf94e373` (UP and healthy)
- API: Responding on http://localhost:8669
- Blockchain: Generating blocks (currently at #10+)
- Genesis: `0x00000000c05a20fbca2bf6ae3affba6af4a74b800b585bf7a4988aba7aea69f6`

## VeWorld Chrome Extension Setup

**Add this network to VeWorld:**
```
Network Name: Solo Node
RPC URL: http://localhost:8669
Chain ID: 39
Symbol: VET
```

## Pre-funded Test Accounts
Your Solo node comes with test accounts from this mnemonic:
`denial kitchen pet squirrel other broom bar gas better priority spoil cross`

**Example accounts you can import:**
- Account 1: Derived from the mnemonic above
- Account 2: Derived from the mnemonic above
- Each has VET and VTHO for testing

## Next Steps
1. Add the Solo network to VeWorld
2. Import an account using the mnemonic
3. You'll see VET and VTHO balances
4. Deploy B3TR tokens to this Solo node
5. Test ReCircle with real blockchain transactions

## Key Difference
This is a REAL VeChain Solo blockchain, not a simulation. VeWorld will properly connect and show real balances and transactions.

The Solo node is producing blocks every 10 seconds and ready for testing!
