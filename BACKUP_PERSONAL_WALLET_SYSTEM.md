# BACKUP: Personal Wallet Distribution System

## Working Configuration (August 10, 2025)

This documents the **proven, working personal wallet system** that was successfully processing receipts and distributing real B3TR tokens before switching to VeBetterDAO treasury.

### System Components:
- **Distribution Module**: `server/utils/working-distribution.ts`
- **Environment Variable**: `USE_VEBETTERDAO_TREASURY=false` (or unset)
- **Token Source**: Personal distributor wallet balance
- **Distributor Address**: `0xF1f72b305b7bf7b25e85D356927aF36b88dC84Ee`

### Last Successful Transaction:
- **User TX**: `0x8c46173b86930f3d85b92ef293b849a319a7e0d2fcda0468c22018cf7f80ec70`
- **App TX**: `0xe581731cdfe843d3d8a0b12377c96f2f5de96414d5438fae557d376111063c18`
- **Amount**: 18 B3TR total (12.6 to user, 5.4 to app fund)
- **Distribution**: 70/30 split working perfectly

### How to Restore Personal Wallet System:
1. Set `USE_VEBETTERDAO_TREASURY=false` in `.env`
