# Simple Testing Steps - What We'll Do Right Now

## Step 1: Check What's Actually Working
✅ Solo node responds to: http://localhost:5000/solo/accounts  
✅ Pierre distribution creates transaction hashes  
✅ Backend processes receipts correctly  

## Step 2: Create Real B3TR on Solo Node
Instead of fighting with ethers.js, let's use the solo node's built-in capabilities:

1. **Add B3TR balance directly to solo node accounts**
2. **Test transfers between accounts**  
3. **Verify VeWorld can see the tokens**

## Step 3: Update Backend Distribution
Once B3TR exists on solo, update the backend to:
1. Use real B3TR contract calls
2. Send actual tokens to user wallets
3. Show in VeWorld immediately

## Step 4: Test End-to-End
1. Submit receipt
2. Get B3TR distributed
3. See tokens in VeWorld wallet
4. Celebrate success! 

## What You'll See Working
- Real B3TR tokens in VeWorld wallet
- Actual blockchain transactions on solo node
- Complete receipt-to-tokens flow working

## Timeline
- Next 30 minutes: Deploy real B3TR to solo
- Next 15 minutes: Test distribution
- Next 15 minutes: Verify in VeWorld

Total: About 1 hour to have everything working perfectly.
